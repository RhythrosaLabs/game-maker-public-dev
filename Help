# Help & Frequently Asked Questions

## Basics

1. **What is this tool?**  
   This is an AI-powered game development assistant that helps you create a complete game plan, including game concepts, assets, scripts, and additional elements using artificial intelligence.

2. **Do I need coding skills to use this tool?**  
   No, basic game design knowledge helps, but coding is not required. However, generated scripts come with comments, so some understanding can enhance your experience.

3. **What do I need to get started?**  
   You'll need a game idea and API keys for OpenAI and Replicate. You can enter them in the sidebar (to the left).

## Using the Tool

4. **How do I use this tool?**  
   - Start by entering your game concept under the "Game Concept" tab.
   - Customize asset generation and script generation in the relevant tabs.
   - Click 'Generate Game Plan' to create your game concept, images, scripts, and additional elements.

5. **What if I don’t like the generated results?**  
   You can tweak inputs or regenerate specific assets by adjusting options and rerunning the generation.

6. **Can I edit the generated content?**  
   Yes, all generated content is editable and meant to be customized to fit your specific needs.

## Game Assets

7. **What game assets can this tool generate?**  
   You can generate:
   - **Images:** Characters, enemies, backgrounds, objects, textures, sprites, and UI elements.
   - **Scripts:** Code for Unity, Unreal Engine, or Blender.
   - **Music:** Background music for your game using AI music generation models.
   - **Additional Text:** Game concepts, storylines, character backgrounds, etc.

8. **What image models are available?**  
   The tool supports models such as OpenAI’s DALL·E 3, SDXL, and MidJourney to create game images based on your prompts.

9. **Can I create 3D models?**  
   Yes, you can convert 2D images to 3D models using Replicate's Wonder3D model. While this feature is still evolving, it provides basic 3D representations of selected assets.

## Scripts and Code

10. **What kinds of scripts can this tool generate?**  
   You can generate:
   - **Player Character scripts** (WASD movement, jumping, attacking).
   - **Enemy AI scripts** (pathfinding, attack mechanics).
   - **Object interaction scripts** (collectibles, traps).
   - **Background management scripts** (parallax scrolling, day/night cycles).

11. **What programming languages are supported?**  
   You can generate scripts in:
   - **C# for Unity**
   - **C++ for Unreal Engine**
   - **Python for Blender**

## AI Models

12. **What AI models are used for generating content?**  
    - **Chat Models:** GPT-4, GPT-4o-mini, Llama 2 for text generation such as game concepts and scripts.
    - **Image Models:** DALL-E 3, SDXL, Midjourney for creating visual assets.
    - **Music Models:** Replicate's MusicGen model for background music generation.

## Troubleshooting

13. **What should I do if I encounter errors?**  
    - Double-check your API keys.
    - Ensure your internet connection is stable.
    - Retry generating the content, or try using different models.

14. **Why does content generation take time?**  
    The time taken depends on the complexity of the content and the AI models being used. Complex game plans or large assets may take a few minutes.

15. **Can I download all the generated assets?**  
    Yes, after the game plan is generated, you can download a ZIP file containing all assets, scripts, and other content.
